Paste App

Instant text storage & sharing: Create, edit, and delete text snippets (“pastes”) with unique links you can copy, share, or revisit anytime.

Organized & searchable: Titles, full‑text search, and timestamps (“June 21st 2025”) make it easy to find the right paste fast.

Built for speed & privacy: React + Redux front‑end stores pastes locally (or syncs with an API), offering clipboard copy, URL‑based editing, and one‑click social sharing—all without exposing private data.
